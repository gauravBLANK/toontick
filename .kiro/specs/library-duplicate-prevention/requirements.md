# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where signed-in users can add duplicate manhwa entries to their library when adding from the 'Featured Manhwa' section. The system should prevent duplicate entries and provide clear feedback to users when they attempt to add a manhwa that already exists in their library.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a signed-in user, I want the system to prevent me from adding duplicate manhwa to my library, so that I don't have multiple copies of the same manhwa cluttering my collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a signed-in user attempts to add a manhwa from Featured Manhwa THEN the system SHALL check if the manhwa already exists in their library
2. IF the manhwa already exists in the user's library THEN the system SHALL prevent the duplicate insertion
3. WHEN a duplicate insertion is prevented THEN the system SHALL return a 409 Conflict response with appropriate error message
4. WHEN the frontend receives a 409 Conflict response THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message like "Already in library"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a signed-in user, I want to receive clear feedback when I try to add a manhwa that's already in my library, so that I understand why the action didn't complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a duplicate manhwa addition is attempted THEN the system SHALL display a notification message to the user
2. WHEN the notification is shown THEN the message SHALL clearly indicate the manhwa is already in their library
3. WHEN the notification appears THEN it SHALL be visually distinct from success messages
4. WHEN the notification is displayed THEN it SHALL automatically dismiss after a reasonable time period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the library database to maintain data integrity by preventing duplicate entries, so that the system remains performant and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL query the library table using both userId and manhwaId
2. WHEN a duplicate check is performed THEN the system SHALL complete the check before attempting any insertion
3. IF a duplicate is found THEN the system SHALL not modify the database
4. WHEN handling duplicate prevention THEN the system SHALL maintain transaction integrity
5. WHEN performing duplicate checks THEN the system SHALL handle database errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the duplicate prevention logic to be implemented in the backend controller, so that the business logic is centralized and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing duplicate prevention THEN the logic SHALL be placed in the backend library controller
2. WHEN checking for duplicates THEN the system SHALL validate the user is authenticated
3. WHEN a duplicate check fails due to database error THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error response
4. WHEN the duplicate check succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal insertion flow
5. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
